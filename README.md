## Facial Authentication System 


## Project Description

The web-based Facial Authentication System is a platform designed for user authentication using facial recognition technology. It allows users to log in or sign up by verifying their identity through facial features captured by a webcam. The system utilizes the Facenet model for facial recognition and runs on a Flask server, which hosts the Keras neural network model for processing facial data.

## My Role
As part of the team, my role involved collaborating with team members to design and implement the web-based system. I contributed to the development of the frontend interface, integration of the Facenet model with the Flask server, and testing the system's functionality.

## Technologies Used
Flask: for the server-side application
Keras: for the neural network model implementation
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: for the frontend interface
Webcam API: for capturing facial images
Facenet model: for facial recognition

## Key Features and Functionalities

Facial Authentication: Users can log in or sign up by capturing their facial features through a webcam.

Secure Authentication: The system uses advanced facial recognition technology for secure user authentication.

User Management: The system allows for the management of user accounts, including creation, deletion, and modification.

Responsive Design: The frontend interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Error Handling: The system includes error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and provide informative feedback to users.

Logging and Monitoring: The system logs user authentication activities for monitoring and audit purposes.
